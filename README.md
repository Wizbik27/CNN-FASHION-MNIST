Overview
The goal of this project is to build and train a CNN to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and it achieves a training accuracy of 99.85% and a validation accuracy of 99.07%.

Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels.

Model Architecture
The CNN architecture consists of the following layers:

Conv2D: 64 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation
MaxPooling2D: pool size 2x2
Conv2D: 64 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation
MaxPooling2D: pool size 2x2
Flatten
Dense: 128 units, ReLU activation
Dense: 10 units, Softmax activation
Training
The model is trained for 5 epochs with the following configurations:

Optimizer: Adam
Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
Metrics: Accuracy
